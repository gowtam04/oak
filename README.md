# Oak

A web chat agent that answers natural-language questions about Pokémon — moves,
abilities, types, stats, evolutions, items, catch locations, and game-mechanic
interactions. Its defining trait is that it **reasons on top of data**: tools
supply the raw building blocks (move priority values, ability effect text, type
charts, base stats) sourced from the [`@pkmn`](https://github.com/pkmn)
ecosystem, and the agent deduces how those pieces interact.

> Example: _"does Fake Out work on Farigiraf?"_ → "Fake Out is a +3 priority
> move; Armor Tail negates priority moves; if Farigiraf has Armor Tail, Fake Out
> fails." Every answer carries its reasoning, the cited data, an explicit
> inference/uncertainty flag, and the generation/format it's based on (Gen 9
> baseline with flagged fallback).

It serves two blended use cases: **competitive team-building** (filter queries,
mechanics reasoning, battle math) and **general Pokédex curiosity** (lookups,
evolutions, matchups, items, where-to-catch, trivia).

## Status

✅ **Implemented and deployed.** Runs in production on [Fly.io](https://fly.io)
(app `oak-gowtam`). The codebase is the source of truth; the docs below describe
the design intent.

## Features

- **Reasoned, cited answers.** Each response is a Zod-validated `OakAnswer`
  rendered field-by-field: the answer, the reasoning, cited sources, explicit
  inference/uncertainty flags, and the generation/format it's based on.
- **Accounts are optional.** Anyone can use Oak as a **guest** (in-memory,
  per-session multi-turn). Signing in with an **email one-time code** unlocks the
  durable, per-account features below. Guests and signed-in users get separate,
  tiered rate limits.
- **Durable chat history** (signed-in) — conversations persist in Postgres, with
  search, format filter, pin, rename, and delete. A guest thread is imported into
  the account on first sign-in.
- **Team builder** (signed-in) — create, edit, import, and export teams (Showdown
  paste format). A team can be set **active** for a conversation, scoping the
  agent's answers to that team.
- **Artifact viewer** — answers can open rich, interactive side-panel artifacts
  (Pokémon, moves, abilities, items, teams, comparisons, damage calcs, type
  matchups) with clickable entity links and citations.
- **Image input (vision)** — attach up to 4 images per turn ("what is this?",
  "rate this team sheet"); all three models are vision-capable.
- **Champions mode** — a header toggle switches the entire data scope between the
  standard Scarlet/Violet index and the **Champions** regulation format.
- **Admin panel** (operator-only) — a private, **read-only** `/admin` dashboard
  for the single owner: usage/growth, estimated cost by model, error rollups,
  per-turn drill-down, a live view, and read-only account/conversation/team
  browsers. It is gated by an `ADMIN_EMAILS` allowlist on top of the existing
  email-OTP auth (see [Admin panel](#admin-panel)).

## Stack

A single **TypeScript / Next.js (App Router) monolith** — one language across
frontend, API, agent loop, and the ingest CLI.

- **Data** — **Postgres + Drizzle ORM** (node-postgres), one row-set per format
  (`scarlet-violet` / `champions`). The index is built offline from the `@pkmn`
  ecosystem (`@pkmn/dex`, `@pkmn/data`, `@pkmn/mods`). The one exception is
  encounter (catch-location) data, which comes from a **committed PokeAPI
  snapshot** — see [Data](#data) below.
- **Agent** — a provider-agnostic tool-loop over **14 tools** that return
  structured facts; the model reasons on top and emits a Zod-validated
  `OakAnswer`.
- **Models** — **xAI Grok 4.3** (native Responses API) is the primary/default,
  with **Claude** and **GPT-5.5** selectable. The active model is **operator-
  controlled** via the `ACTIVE_MODEL` secret — there is no in-app model picker.
- **Transport** — **Server-Sent Events** stream tool activity then a
  token-by-token answer.
- **Validation** — **Zod** is the single source of truth (runtime validation,
  inferred types, and the provider tool / `submit_answer` JSON Schemas).
- **Auth** — email + one-time-code (OTP) sessions; OTP email sent via
  [Resend](https://resend.com) (a console transport logs the code in local dev).
- **Tests** — **Vitest**, two projects (a Node project backed by an ephemeral
  Testcontainers Postgres, and a jsdom project for components).

## Data

All index data (Pokémon, moves, abilities, items, types, learnsets) is built
**offline** from the local `@pkmn` packages — `npm run ingest` makes no network
calls and is fully deterministic.

The single exception is **encounter / catch-location data**, which `@pkmn`
doesn't provide. It comes from a committed snapshot at
`web/src/ingest/data/encounters.json`, crawled from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
**manually and rarely** via `npm run fetch:encounters` (the only place Oak ever
touches the network). Ingest reads that committed file via `fs`, so the build
stays offline. Coverage is **Gen 1 → Sword/Shield + Let's Go only** — PokeAPI has
no encounter records for Scarlet/Violet, Legends: Arceus, or BDSP, and the agent
surfaces that gap transparently. Encounters are standard-mode only (Champions
ships none).

## Getting started

Requires Node 20+ (`.nvmrc`) and a Docker daemon (for the local Postgres and the
test suite). The app lives in **`web/`** — run every command from there. A future
mobile client would be a sibling folder; `docs/` stays at the repo root.

```bash
cd web
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # add XAI_API_KEY (required); other keys are optional
npm run docker:dev           # Postgres + next dev on :3000 (the intended dev environment)
npm run docker:migrate       # apply Drizzle migrations
npm run docker:ingest        # build the index from @pkmn (migrates first)
```

Only `XAI_API_KEY` is required to boot (Grok is the default model). The other
keys are optional and validated on use:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` — needed only if you point `ACTIVE_MODEL`
  at Claude or GPT-5.5.
- `AUTH_SECRET` — HMAC secret for OTP codes (a dev default is used locally; a
  strong value is required in production).
- `RESEND_API_KEY` — to send real OTP emails. Absent ⇒ the code is logged to the
  console (fine for local dev).
- `ADMIN_EMAILS` — comma-separated allowlist of admin emails for the `/admin`
  panel. Unset ⇒ zero admins ⇒ the panel is dark (the safe default). See
  [Admin panel](#admin-panel).

To run the Next dev server directly against a local Postgres instead of in Docker:

```bash
npm run db:migrate && npm run ingest && npm run dev
```

## Models

Three providers plug into one provider-agnostic loop. **Grok 4.3** (xAI's native
Responses API) is the default; **Claude** and **GPT-5.5** are drop-in
alternatives. The active model is chosen by the operator, not the end user:

```bash
fly secrets set ACTIVE_MODEL=claude   # grok-4.3 (default) | claude | gpt-5.5
```

Switching is one secret change, no rebuild. The chosen model's provider key must
be configured or the request returns a clean 503; an unknown value fails fast at
boot.

## Admin panel

A private, **read-only** operator dashboard for the single owner, served as a
protected `/admin` route group inside the same Next.js app (no second deploy).
It surfaces usage & growth, **estimated** cost by model, error rollups, a
searchable per-turn drill-down, a live activity view, and read-only browsers for
accounts, conversations, and saved teams. It mutates nothing — the only writes
the feature adds are the two append-only records below.

- **Access** — reuses the existing email-OTP login, gated by an `ADMIN_EMAILS`
  allowlist (comma-separated). Set it as a secret:

  ```bash
  fly secrets set ADMIN_EMAILS=you@example.com,ops@example.com
  ```

  The allowlist is read from the environment at call time, and gating is
  enforced **server-side on every `/api/admin/*` request** plus the `/admin`
  layout. **Unset `ADMIN_EMAILS` ⇒ zero admins ⇒ the panel is dark** (the safe
  default); there is no link to it from the main app — reach it at the `/admin`
  URL.
- **Recording enabler** — Oak now persists **one `turn_record` per chat turn**
  (guest **and** signed-in: prompt text, answer, model, mode, token counts, tool
  trace, status, timing) and **one `auth_event` per auth event** (code
  requested / verified / delivery failed). Recording is **non-blocking and
  best-effort** — fired as `void recordX(...).catch(logOnly)`, never awaited on
  the chat or auth path, so it can never fail or slow a user's turn. These two
  tables are the analytics store the panel reads.
- **Cost is an estimate** — dollar figures come from a static in-code per-model
  price table and are always labelled as estimates; provider billing is
  authoritative.
- **Retention** — recorded turns and auth events are retained **indefinitely**
  (no prune job). Because this means **guest** prompts and answers — previously
  ephemeral — are now stored and readable by the operator, the
  [privacy policy](web/src/app/privacy/page.tsx) discloses operator read access
  and usage recording.

[`docs/features/admin-panel/`](docs/features/admin-panel/).

## Deploy

Deployed to Fly from `web/` (`cd web && fly deploy`) via the production
`Dockerfile` (`output: "standalone"`). The
release command runs `migrate.mjs` (a plain-ESM migration runner) before the new
version takes traffic, so migrations apply atomically on each deploy. A single
always-on machine backs the in-memory guest session store, rate limiter, and OTP
throttle; `/api/health` is a DB-free liveness probe. See [`docs/`](docs/) and the
deployment notes for details.
