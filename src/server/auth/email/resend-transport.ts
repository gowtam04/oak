/**
 * Resend email transport (account-creation design.md § Tech Stack /

 * A tiny `fetch`-based client — no new npm dependency, matching the codebase's
 * lean-deps posture. It POSTs to the Resend "send email" endpoint with the API
 * key as a bearer token. A non-2xx response THROWS a transport fault; the
 * caller (`auth-service`) catches it and maps it to the in-domain
 * `email_failed` result (it does not retry or model failure shapes here).
