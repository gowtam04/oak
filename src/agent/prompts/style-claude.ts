/**
 * Claude prompt style — the canonical, unchanged Oak prompt.
 *
 * Produces the SAME two system segments the runtime used inline before the
 * model switcher (the domain system body, then the few-shot with the single
 * ephemeral cache breakpoint on the last segment). Keeping this byte-identical
 * is what guarantees the Claude path (still fully supported, selectable in the
 * switcher) does not regress and its prompt cache stays warm. Claude reads the
 * XML-light, "you are"-framed, adaptive-
 * thinking prompt well, so no extra scaffolding is layered on.
