/**
 * T11 — `submit_answer` (tools.md T11, structured-output / terminal action).
 *
 * The tool's input IS the full `PokebotAnswer` object (schemas.ts /
 * output-formats.md). `run` validates the payload against the single-source Zod
 * schema and echoes it back:
 *   - on success -> the validated PokebotAnswer (the runtime returns this to the
 *     caller and the frontend renders it),
 *   - on failure -> { error: "invalid_input", detail } so the runtime can return
 *     the validation error to the model and request a re-emit (integration.md);
 *     it never throws.
 *
 * The runtime owns loop termination + the retry budget; this tool only performs
 * the schema check so a malformed payload can't reach the route.
