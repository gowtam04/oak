/**
 * Model registry — the single source of truth for which LLMs the model switcher
 * exposes (Grok 4.3 / Claude / GPT-5.5).
 *
 * CLIENT-SAFE by design: this module holds ONLY pure constants/mappings and has
 * NO `server-only`, SDK, or `@/env` imports — modeled on `src/data/formats.ts`.
 * That lets the frontend (`page.tsx` / `ModelSelector`), the API route's body
 * validation, the prompts layer, and the runtime all import the SAME list so a
 * model key never gets hardcoded twice and never drifts between the dropdown and
 * the server whitelist.
 *
 * The concrete per-provider wiring (API model id, reasoning effort, SDK client,
 * API key) deliberately lives in the SERVER-ONLY provider factory
 * (`src/agent/providers/factory.ts`), keyed off {@link ModelOption.provider}, so
 * this file stays free of secrets and SDKs and safe to bundle for the client.
