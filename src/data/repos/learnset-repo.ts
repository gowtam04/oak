/**
 * LearnsetRepo — typed reads over the DS-3 Gen-9 `learnset` table
 * (design.md § Interface Definitions; Phase 4 "Tools").
 *
 * Two read paths, both pure SQL computed *in the database* (never by the model):
 *
 *   - `pokemonLearningAll` — the multi-move **intersection** (BR-7). Given a set
 *     of move slugs and the active `format`, returns the ids of every Pokémon
 *     whose learnset contains ALL of them. Implemented as a single
 *     `GROUP BY pokemon_id HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT move_slug) = N` over the rows
 *     filtered by `move_slug IN (...)` AND `format = ...` — exactly the SQL shape
 *     mandated by the RISK DIRECTIVES / design.md § learnset table.
 *
 *   - `gen9LearnerCount` — how many distinct Pokémon learn a given move in Gen 9
 *     (backs `get_move`'s optional `gen9_learner_count`, T4). The `learnset`
 *     table is built by ingest for Gen-9 version groups only (D6/BR-2), so a
 *     plain `COUNT(DISTINCT pokemon_id)` over the move already respects Gen-9.
 *
 * Module boundary (design.md § Code Conventions): repos are the sole SQLite
 * readers. The Drizzle handle is threaded in by the caller (the per-request
 * DbCtx assembled in src/agent/context.ts) rather than imported here, so this
 * module has no eager DB-connection side effect and stays trivially testable
 * against a fixture database. `PokebotDb` is imported type-only for that reason.
 *
 * better-sqlite3 is synchronous — these functions return plain values
 * (`string[]` / `number`), never Promises, and nothing here is awaited.

/**
 * Ids of every Pokémon that can learn **all** of `moveIds` within `format`
 * (the learnset intersection, BR-7).
 *
 * Computed entirely in SQL:
 *
 * ```sql
 * SELECT pokemon_id
 *   FROM learnset
 *  WHERE move_slug IN (:moveIds)
 *    AND format = :format
 *  GROUP BY pokemon_id
 * HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT move_slug) = :N      -- N = distinct requested moves
 *  ORDER BY pokemon_id;                       -- stable, deterministic ordering
 * ```
 *
 * - Duplicate slugs in `moveIds` are de-duplicated first, so the `HAVING` count
 *   target `N` is the number of *distinct* requested moves (a duplicate must not
 *   inflate the threshold and make every match impossible).
 * - An empty `moveIds` set has an empty intersection by definition → returns
 *   `[]` (and avoids emitting an `IN ()` clause).
 *
 * @param moveIds  canonical move slugs to intersect.
 * @param format   the active data scope ("scarlet-violet" | "champions").
 * @param database the Drizzle handle (from the request's DbCtx / fixture).
 * @returns sorted list of matching `pokemon.id` slugs (possibly empty).
