/**
 * SSE event protocol for `POST /api/chat` (design.md § API Design).
 *
 * The route emits, in order:
 *   event: tool_activity   data: { tool, label }     (zero or more)
 *   event: answer_start    data: {}                  (zero or more; resets the
 *                                                      client's in-flight buffer
 *                                                      when a fresh submit_answer
 *                                                      begins streaming)
 *   event: answer_delta    data: { text }            (zero or more; incremental
 *                                                      chunks of answer_markdown)
 *   event: answer          data: { answer }          (exactly one, terminal,
 *                                                      authoritative)
 *   event: error           data: { code, message }   (transport faults ONLY)
 *
 * IMPORTANT: every in-domain failure (unresolved entity, clarification, PokeAPI
 * down, index missing, loop-max, invalid-after-retry) is delivered as a NORMAL
 * `answer` event carrying a PokebotAnswer with the appropriate `status`
 * (resolution_failed / clarification_needed / insufficient_data) — NEVER as an
 * `error` event. The `error` event is reserved for model/API transport faults.
 *
 * `answer_start` / `answer_delta` stream the `answer_markdown` prose token-by-
 * token while the loop runs; the single terminal `answer` event always carries
 * the full validated PokebotAnswer and is authoritative (the client replaces any
 * streamed buffer with it).
