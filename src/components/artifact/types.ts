/**
 * Client-side artifact-viewer view types + the context API (B-4, Phase 4).
 *
 * The viewer shows ONE artifact at a time (BR-AV-4) backed by a back-stack
 * (AV-US-5/6): every open pushes, `back` pops, `close` clears. Two artifact
 * sources (TD-2): ENTITY artifacts are fetched from `/api/entity`; STRUCTURED
 * artifacts (comparison, damage-calc) are derived from the committed
 * `OakAnswer` payload (no fetch). The current data `format` is snapshotted
 * onto each view at open time (BR-AV-7).
 *
 * Type-only module — safe for client + isolation tests.
