/**
 * eval/judge.ts — LLM-as-judge rubric + scoring (design.md Phase 8; evaluation.md § Metrics).
 *
 * WIRED but NOT RUN LIVE in the current build phase.
 * eval/run.ts controls when runJudged is invoked (nightly / on release).
 *
 * Exports:
 *   Types:
 *     GoldenCase        — shared case contract (cases.ts, deterministic.ts, run.ts)
 *     AssertResult      — structural-only result for the Vitest CI subset
 *     RubricDimension   — string union of LLM-judged dimensions
 *     RubricScore       — per-dimension score (0/1/2 + reason)
 *     JudgeResult       — full result: structural failures + LLM rubric + timing
 *     JudgeClientLike   — injectable judge-client seam
 *     RunPokebotFn      — injectable runPokebot seam
 *   Functions:
 *     runStructural     — structural assertions only (fast, no LLM).
 *                         Exported for eval/deterministic.ts CI subset.
 *     runJudgedWith     — full pipeline with injected clients (used in tests).
 *     runJudged         — production entry point (real Anthropic + real runPokebot).
 *
 * Risk-directive note:
 *   The judge uses `tool_choice: { type: "tool", name: "submit_judgment" }` WITHOUT
 *   adaptive thinking. The HARD 400 on Sonnet 4.6 fires only when thinking AND
 *   forced tool_choice are BOTH enabled. Omitting thinking for the judge is correct
 *   and intentional — it does not need reasoning chains, only rubric application.

const JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an expert evaluator for Pokebot, a Pokémon knowledge agent built on Gen 9 (Scarlet/Violet) data.
Your task: given a user question, a description of the expected behavior, and the agent's PokebotAnswer JSON, score the answer on five rubric dimensions.
Each dimension gets an integer score: 0 (fail), 1 (partial pass), or 2 (full pass).

RUBRIC DIMENSIONS

1. answer_correctness
   Is the answer's bottom-line conclusion factually correct with correct Pokémon mechanics?
   2 = clearly correct and complete — no factual errors, no missing critical pieces.
   1 = mostly correct but has a minor gap, omission, or a low-stakes imprecision.
   0 = wrong conclusion, fabricated Pokémon data, or a critical mechanical error.

2. inference_flagging
   Are the agent's OWN DEDUCTIONS placed in inferences[] with a confidence level?
   Facts the tools returned (priority values, stat numbers, effect text) should NOT be in inferences[].
   Conversely, deductions like "Armor Tail therefore blocks Fake Out" MUST be in inferences[].
   2 = perfectly separated — all deductions flagged, no facts mislabeled.
   1 = one item mislabeled (a fact in inferences, or a deduction omitted).
   0 = systematic failure — key deductions absent, or inferences[] filled with plain facts.

3. mechanics_precision
   For type effectiveness, priority, ability effects, and formula results:
   are the specifics precise? Critical test: immunities MUST be stated as "immune" or "0×",
   NOT as "not very effective". Priority values and ability effect text must be accurate.
   2 = all mechanical assertions precise.
   1 = mostly precise with a minor wording imprecision that doesn't change the conclusion.
   0 = mechanical error that would mislead the player (e.g. calling an immunity a resistance).

4. scope_adherence
   In-scope queries (moves, abilities, types, stats, evolutions, items, mechanics): answered?
   Out-of-scope queries (egg moves, catch locations, breeding, full battle simulation): politely
   declined with an offer of relevant in-scope help?
   2 = correct handling.
   1 = minor boundary error (declined something slightly in-scope, or answered a borderline edge).
   0 = wrong — answered an out-of-scope query as fact, or refused a clearly in-scope query.

5. transparency
   Does the answer state its reasoning, assumptions, and cite tool-returned data?
   Stat/damage calculations must state every assumed input (level, EVs, IVs, nature) and mark
   the result as an estimate. Citations must reference specific data points.
   2 = fully transparent — reasoning explained, all assumptions stated, citations specific.
   1 = mostly transparent — one assumption unstated or one unexplained reasoning step.
   0 = opaque — no reasoning, no assumptions stated for math, or no citations for factual claims.

Use the submit_judgment tool to return your five scores. Keep each reason field to ≤ 2 sentences.`;
