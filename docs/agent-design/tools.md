# Tools

Read-data tools (one queries the local index, seven fetch reference details, one
resolves names, two read the user's saved teams — `list_teams` lists them and
`get_team` loads one by id), two compute battle math, one emits the final answer,
and one writes (saves a team on approval). All read/compute tools are **read-only
and idempotent** — safe to retry in the loop. Tools return **structured errors the
model can reason about**, never raw exceptions.

> `get_encounters` (T14) was added later for catch-location / obtain-method data
> sourced from a committed PokeAPI snapshot. It is **standard-mode only**
> (Champions ships no encounter data; the tool returns
> `not_available_in_champions` in that mode) and its coverage is Gen 1 →
> Sword/Shield + Let's Go — PokeAPI has no encounter data for Scarlet/Violet,
> Legends: Arceus, or BDSP, which the tool/prompt surface transparently.

> Tools beyond the original eleven were added by the **team-builder** feature
> (see `docs/features/team-builder/architecture/design.md`): `get_team` (T12) +
> `list_teams` (T16) read the user's saved teams, and `save_team` (T13, TEAM-AD-7)
> writes one. `save_team` is the single deliberate exception to "the agent never
> writes a team" (BR-T8): it writes ONLY on an explicit user approval the prompt
> describes, mirroring the manual Apply button — see T13.
>
> **Superseded:** the original T12 `get_active_team` (a server-bound, arg-less
> read of a conversation-selected "active team", TEAM-AD-1 / TEAM-AD-3) was
> replaced once the header active-team selector was removed. Saved teams are now
> referenced **by name in chat**: the model calls `list_teams` (T16) to see the
> account's teams for the turn's format, matches the user's words against the team
> names + Pokémon, then loads the chosen one with `get_team({ team_id })` (T12).
> The `conversation.active_team_id` column and the `active_team_id` request/PATCH
> field were dropped with it.

Conventions:

- Names accepted by detail tools are canonical PokeAPI slugs (`will-o-wisp`,
  `flash-fire`). Use `resolve_entity` first if unsure.
- Every detail tool's miss returns `{ found: false, suggestions: [...] }` rather
  than throwing, so the agent can resolve-or-clarify (BR-9).
- Generation context defaults to Gen 9; tools surface `is_gen9_native` /
  `source_generation` so the agent can flag fallback (BR-1).

## T1 — `resolve_entity`

**Description (for the model):** Resolve a possibly-misspelled or ambiguous name
to canonical Pokémon-data entities. Use this when the user's wording for a
Pokémon, move, ability, type, or item might not exactly match a real name, or
when a name is ambiguous across forms. Returns ranked candidate matches with
their canonical slugs.

**Input schema:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "query": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The name as the user wrote it, e.g. 'Will-o-Whisp', 'Farigiraf', 'Trik Room'."
    },
    "kind": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["pokemon", "move", "ability", "type", "item", "any"],
      "default": "any",
      "description": "Restrict the search to one entity kind, or 'any' to search all."
    },
    "limit": { "type": "integer", "default": 5, "minimum": 1, "maximum": 10 }
  },
  "required": ["query"]
}
```

**Output shape (sample):**

```json
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "kind": "move",
      "slug": "will-o-wisp",
      "display_name": "Will-O-Wisp",
      "score": 0.94
    },
    { "kind": "move", "slug": "wisp", "display_name": "—", "score": 0.0 }
  ]
}
```

**Side effects:** Read-only. Idempotent. **Failure modes:** none fatal — returns
`{ "matches": [] }` when nothing is close (agent then says it can't resolve and
asks). **Auth:** none.

## T2 — `query_pokedex` _(the workhorse)_

**Description (for the model):** Search the local Pokédex index for Pokémon
matching structured filters, with optional sorting and a result limit. Use this
for any filter, threshold, superlative ("fastest"), or compound query — never
fetch Pokémon one by one for these. Pass multiple moves to get the **set of
Pokémon that can learn ALL of them** in Gen 9 (intersection). Returns the total
match count plus the top-N rows with stats, types, abilities, and sprite.

**Input schema:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "types": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string" },

              "special_defense",
              "speed",
              "base_stat_total"
            ]
          },
          "op": { "type": "string", "enum": [">", ">=", "<", "<=", "=="] },
          "value": { "type": "integer" }
        },
        "required": ["stat", "op", "value"]
      },
      "description": "Numeric base-stat constraints, ANDed together (e.g. attack > 130)."
    },
    "sort_by": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": [
        "hp",
        "attack",
        "defense",
        "special_attack",
        "special_defense",
        "speed",
        "base_stat_total",
        "national_dex_number"
      ],
      "description": "Stat/field to rank by — use for superlatives like 'fastest' (sort_by=speed, order=desc)."
    },
    "order": { "type": "string", "enum": ["asc", "desc"], "default": "desc" },
    "limit": { "type": "integer", "default": 20, "minimum": 1, "maximum": 100 }

}
```

**Output shape (sample):**

```json
{
  "total_count": 7,
  "truncated": false,
  "sort": "speed desc",
  "results": [
    {
      "display_name": "Garchomp",

      "is_gen9_native": true,
      "source_generation": null
    }
  ]
}
```

**Side effects:** Read-only against DS-2/DS-3. Idempotent. **Failure modes:**
`{ "error": "index_unavailable" }`; or `{ "unresolved": ["trik-room"] }` when a
passed move/ability/type slug isn't in the index (agent should `resolve_entity`
and retry). Empty match returns `{ "total_count": 0, "results": [] }` —
**not** an error; agent reports "none found" honestly. **Auth:** none.

> Multi-move note: `moves` intersection is computed in code over DS-3 (Gen-9
> learnsets), so the result already respects BR-2/BR-7. The agent should still
> cite each move's learnset as the source.

## T3 — `get_pokemon`

**Description (for the model):** Get the full profile of one specific Pokémon
form: its types, all abilities (including the hidden ability), base stats,
sprite/artwork, national dex number, available forms, and which generation the
data is from. Use for single-Pokémon lookups (US-4) and to ground reasoning.

**Input schema:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Canonical Pokémon slug, e.g. 'garchomp', 'tauros-paldea-aqua'."

}
```

**Side effects:** Read-only (DS-2). Idempotent. **Failure modes:**
`{ "found": false, "suggestions": ["farigiraf"] }`. **Auth:** none.

---

## T4 — `get_move`

**Description (for the model):** Get a move's mechanical details — type, power,
accuracy, PP, **priority**, damage class (physical/special/status), target, and
effect text. Use whenever reasoning depends on how a move behaves (e.g. checking
that Fake Out is a priority move). Optionally returns the count of Pokémon that
learn it in Gen 9.

**Input schema:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Canonical move slug, e.g. 'fake-out', 'will-o-wisp'."
    },
    "include_gen9_learner_count": { "type": "boolean", "default": false }
  },
  "required": ["name"]
}
```

**Output shape (sample):**

```json
{
  "found": true,
  "display_name": "Fake Out",
  "type": "normal",
  "damage_class": "physical",
  "power": 40,
  "accuracy": 100,
  "pp": 10,
  "priority": 3,
  "target": "selected-pokemon",
  "effect_short": "Hits first (priority +3) and makes the target flinch; only works on the user's first turn out.",
  "effect_full": "Inflicts regular damage. Has +3 priority. The target flinches... Only succeeds on the first turn after the user switches in.",
  "gen9_learner_count": 112
}
```

**Side effects:** Read-only (DS-4, with DS-3 for the count). Idempotent.
**Failure modes:** `{ "found": false, "suggestions": [...] }`;
`{ "error": "upstream_unavailable" }` on a cache miss while PokeAPI is down.
**Auth:** none.

---

## T5 — `get_ability`

**Description (for the model):** Get an ability's effect text and short
description. Use when reasoning depends on what an ability does (e.g. Armor Tail
negating priority moves, Flash Fire's Fire immunity).

**Input schema:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Canonical ability slug, e.g. 'armor-tail', 'flash-fire'."

```

**Output shape (sample):**

```json
{
  "found": true,
  "display_name": "Armor Tail",
  "effect_short": "Prevents the holder from being hit by moves with increased priority.",
  "effect_full": "The Pokémon and its allies cannot be targeted by opposing moves that have positive priority (e.g. Fake Out, Quick Attack, Extreme Speed)."
}
```

**Side effects:** Read-only (DS-4). Idempotent. **Failure modes:**
`{ "found": false, "suggestions": [...] }`; `{ "error": "upstream_unavailable" }`.
**Auth:** none.

---

## T6 — `get_type_matchups`

**Description (for the model):** Get type effectiveness relationships using the
**latest** type chart. Pass one type for its offensive and defensive profile, or
two types for a combined **defensive** profile (the product of both types'
weaknesses/resistances/immunities). Use for matchup questions (US-6).
Immunities are 0× and must be treated as immunities, not resistances.

**Input schema:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "types": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string" },
      "minItems": 1,
      "maxItems": 2,
      "description": "One type for full profile, or two for a combined defensive matchup (e.g. ['ground','flying'])."
    }
  },
  "required": ["types"]
}
```

**Output shape (sample, single type 'ground'):**

```json
{

```

**Side effects:** Read-only (DS-4). Idempotent. **Failure modes:**
`{ "found": false, "suggestions": [...] }` for an unknown type;
`{ "error": "upstream_unavailable" }`. **Auth:** none.

---

## T7 — `get_evolution_chain`

**Description (for the model):** Get a Pokémon's full evolution line and the
condition(s) for each stage (level, item, friendship, trade, time of day, etc.)
as provided by PokeAPI. Use for evolution questions (US-5).

**Input schema:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "species": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Canonical species slug, e.g. 'eevee'."
    }
  },
  "required": ["species"]

## T8 — `get_item`

**Description (for the model):** Get an item's effect text and, where available,
which Pokémon are found holding it in the wild. Use for item questions (US-8).

**Input schema:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Canonical item slug, e.g. 'leftovers'."
    }

  "effect_full": "At the end of each turn, the holder recovers 1/16 of its maximum HP.",
  "held_by_wild": [{ "pokemon": "snorlax", "rarity_percent": 100 }]
}
```

**Side effects:** Read-only (DS-4). Idempotent. **Failure modes:**
`{ "found": false, "suggestions": [...] }`; `{ "error": "upstream_unavailable" }`.
**Auth:** none.

---

## T9 — `compute_stat`

**Description (for the model):** Compute a Pokémon's final stat at a given level
using the exact in-game formula (handles the per-step flooring). Provide the base
stat (from `get_pokemon`/`query_pokedex`), IV, EV, level, and nature effect on
this stat. Returns the exact value and a step-by-step breakdown. Use this for any
stat-math question — do not compute stats yourself.

**Input schema:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "base_stat": { "type": "integer" },
    "is_hp": {

    }
  },
  "required": ["base_stat"]
}
```

**Output shape (sample — Garchomp Speed, base 102, lvl 50, 252 EV, 31 IV, Jolly):**

```json

## T10 — `estimate_damage`

**Description (for the model):** Estimate damage for one attack using the
standard damage formula, returning the min–max range (from the 0.85–1.0 random
roll) and a breakdown. Provide attacker/defender effective stats, move power,
STAB, type effectiveness multiplier, and any extra modifiers. Use this for
damage questions — do not compute damage yourself. Always present the result as
an estimate.

**Input schema:**

```json

## T11 — `submit_answer` _(structured output / final action)_

**Description (for the model):** Submit your final answer. Call this exactly
once, as your last action, every turn. Its fields populate the user-facing
answer card. Include the direct answer, your reasoning, the specific data you
relied on (citations), any inferences with their confidence, the generation your
answer is based on, and the Pokémon/candidates/calc results to display. If you
couldn't resolve an entity or need clarification, set `status` accordingly and
provide `suggestions`.

**Input schema:** the full `OakAnswer` object — see `output-formats.md` for
the complete JSON Schema and field semantics.

**Side effects:** Terminates the agent loop; the payload is returned to the
caller and rendered by the frontend. Idempotent (one call per turn). **Failure
modes:** if the payload fails schema validation, orchestration returns the
validation error to the model and asks it to re-emit (see `integration.md`).
**Auth:** none.

---

## T12 — `get_team`

_(Team-builder feature. Loads ONE saved team by id; the id comes from
`list_teams`, T16. Replaced the original server-bound `get_active_team`.)_

**Description (for the model):** Load one of the user's saved teams by id — its
members (species, ability, item, moves, nature, EVs/IVs, Tera type, level), their
display names, and any validity/legality warnings. **Pass a `team_id` you got
from `list_teams`** (you cannot guess one). Returns `{ "found": false }` if the id
isn't one of this user's teams in the current format. Use this after `list_teams`
to read the team the user is asking about ("my rain team", "this set") and ground
advice in it.

**Input schema:** a strict `team_id` string.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": { "team_id": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 } },
  "required": ["team_id"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

The team is loaded **account-scoped and format-gated** (`resolveActiveTeam`): an
unknown, not-owned, or wrong-format id all yield `{ "found": false }`, so the model
can never read a team outside the signed-in account or the turn's format. The id
is opaque to the model — it only ever supplies one returned by `list_teams`.

**Output shape (sample):**

```json
{
  "found": true,
  "team": {
    "name": "Sun Offense",
    "format": "scarlet-violet",
    "members": [
      {
        "species": "garchomp",

Display names come from the same `searchable_names` master list `resolve_entity`
uses; the `warnings[]` are computed on demand by `validateTeam` (warn-but-allow,
never stored — so they can't go stale across a re-ingest). Warning codes:
`incomplete`, `ev_total_exceeded`, `ev_stat_exceeded`, `iv_out_of_range`,
`species_illegal`, `ability_not_for_species`, `item_illegal`,
`move_not_in_learnset`, `duplicate_species`, `duplicate_item`.

**Side effects:** Read-only. Idempotent. **Failure modes:** never fatal — a guest,
an unknown/foreign/wrong-format id, OR any read fault while enriching degrades to
`{ "found": false }`. **Auth:** the signed-in account id is bound server-side onto
`AgentContext.accountId`; the tool scopes every read to it (the agent never sees
the id itself).

> **T16 — `list_teams`.** The companion pick-list: takes no arguments and returns
> the user's saved teams for the turn's format — each team's `team_id`, `name`,
> `member_count`, `incomplete` flag, and its Pokémon (`species`, display names) —
> so the model can match a by-name reference against names AND contents, then call
> `get_team`. `{ "signed_in": false }` for a guest; `{ "signed_in": true, "teams":
> [] }` when the account has none. Format-scoped like `get_team` (a Champions team
> never appears in standard mode). Read-only, idempotent, never fatal.

## T13 — `save_team`

_(Added by the team-builder feature — TEAM-AD-7. The one **write** tool.)_

**Description (for the model):** Save a team to the user's saved Teams. Call this
ONLY when the user EXPLICITLY approves a team you proposed earlier in this
conversation ("looks good", "save it", "build this team", "I like this"), or asks
you to build AND save one. It saves the **exact team you proposed** — you do not
pass the members. Optional `name` renames; optional `team` is for build-and-save
in one message (no prior proposal). On `{ "saved": true }`, tell the user it's on
their Teams page (the app opens it in the viewer); on `not_signed_in`, ask them to
sign in; on `no_team`, propose a team first.

**Input schema:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "team": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": { "type": "string" },
        "format": { "enum": ["scarlet-violet", "champions"] },
        "members": { "type": "array" }
      },
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

The team it saves is **server-bound**: the chat route extracts the most recent
`proposed_team` from the conversation's stored answers and binds it onto
`AgentContext.proposedTeam` (the analogue of `activeTeam`), so the saved EVs / IVs
/ moves are byte-for-byte what the user saw — the model never re-types the set.
`team` is only the fallback when there is no prior proposal in context. The new
team becomes the conversation's active team, and the route stamps the saved id +
name + format onto `answer.saved_team` (authoritative — the model never copies a
UUID), which the UI renders as a persistent "Saved ✓ — open in viewer" card.

**Output shape (sample):**

```json
{ "saved": true, "team_id": "…uuid…", "name": "Rain Offense", "format": "champions" }
```

or a structured miss:

```json
{ "saved": false, "reason": "not_signed_in" }
```

**Side effects:** WRITES one team row (account-scoped) + sets the conversation's
active team. **Not** idempotent — calling it twice saves twice, so the prompt
gates it on an explicit one-time approval. **Failure modes:** never throws —
a guest is `{ "saved": false, "reason": "not_signed_in" }`, nothing-to-save is
`"no_team"`, a write fault is `"index_unavailable"`. **Auth:** the account is
server-bound onto the context (the agent never sees an account id); a guest turn
binds none, so a guest can never write.

## T14 — `get_encounters`

**Purpose:** where and how to OBTAIN a Pokémon — wild encounters (walk/surf/
fishing) plus gifts, gift-eggs, static and in-game trades — grouped by game.
Answers "where do I catch / how do I get X" questions. **Standard mode only.**

**Input:** `{ name: string }` — a Pokémon name/slug (resolve_entity first if
unsure). The repo resolves any form to its base species, so locations are
reported at the species level.

**Output (hit):** `{ found: true, name, encounters: EncounterGroup[],
coverage_note: string | null }`, where each `EncounterGroup` is
`{ version_group, generation, versions[], locations: [{ location_display, region,
method, min_level, max_level, chance, conditions[] }] }`. `coverage_note` is set
(and `encounters` empty) when the species has no recorded catch data.

**Misses / modes:** `{ found: false, suggestions }` (unknown name);
`{ error: "index_unavailable" }` (index not built);
`{ error: "not_available_in_champions" }` (Champions turn — encounters are
standard-only). Never throws in-domain.

**Data source & coverage:** built offline at ingest from a committed PokeAPI
snapshot (`src/ingest/data/encounters.json`, produced by
`scripts/fetch-pokeapi-encounters.ts`) into `reference_cache` under
resource_kind `encounters`. **Coverage is Gen 1 → Sword/Shield + Let's Go only**
— PokeAPI has NO encounter data for Scarlet/Violet (Gen 9), Legends: Arceus, or
BDSP; the empty list + `coverage_note` and the prompt make that gap explicit. The
per-game model means a future re-crawl auto-absorbs Gen 9 if PokeAPI fills it in.

(The ❌ marks are the original agent-design backlog state; `get_team`,
`list_teams`, and `save_team` are implemented as part of the team-builder
feature. `get_team` + `list_teams` replaced the original `get_active_team`.)

All tools are new work. None require auth or carry side effects beyond reads —
simplifying retry logic in the loop.
