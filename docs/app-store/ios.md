# Oak — iOS App Store Listing

Category: **Reference**. Age rating: **4+**. Price: **Free, no in-app purchases.**

## App Name (30 chars max)

```
Oak – AI Battle Coach
```
**21 / 30 chars.** The bare name "Oak" was unavailable in the App Store, so a short descriptor was appended to make the store name unique. The bundle id (`us.optiwise.oak`), the `oak.optiwise.us` domain, and the in-app "Oak" assistant persona are all unchanged — only the *store display name* carries the descriptor, so no code change is required. "AI Battle Coach" also pulls double duty for ASO: it puts `ai`, `battle`, and `coach` into Apple's most heavily-weighted field (the bare "Oak" wasted it on 3 characters) and names Oak's category-defining wedge — it *coaches*: it reasons and explains, rather than just computing like the manual-tool competitors (ChampDex, VGC Helper). Separator is an en dash; swap for `:` or `|` to taste (all stay ≤30). (App Store name availability is only confirmed at name-reservation time in App Store Connect — "Battle Coach" is a generic phrase, so collision risk is low.)

## Subtitle (30 chars max)

```
Team Builder & Calculator
```
**25 / 30 chars.** Reworked now that "AI" and "Battle" live in the App Name — the subtitle no longer repeats them and instead carries the next tier of high-intent terms. It locks the exact phrase "team builder" (a Tier-1 search term) into a heavily-weighted field, and "Calculator" combines cross-field with the App Name's "Battle" → "battle calculator" (Tier 1) and with the keyword "damage" → "damage calculator" (Tier 2). Zero trademarked words. (5 chars of headroom remain if you later want to append a term.)

## Promotional Text (170 chars max, updatable without resubmission)

```
New: a one-tap format toggle scopes your whole team chat and battle calculator to the current competitive regulation ruleset — no separate app, no manual rule lookups.
```
**167 / 170 chars.**

## Description (4000 chars max)

```
Oak is your AI battle coach — a chat companion for building and reasoning about competitive creature-battle teams. Ask any question about your roster and get a reasoned, cited answer, not a stat dump.

Most reference apps hand you raw numbers and leave the thinking to you. Oak reasons on top of the data: every answer comes with its reasoning, the sources it's grounded in, and explicit "this part is inferred" flags whenever the data doesn't fully cover your question — so you always know what's fact and what's a best guess.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

• Build full competitive teams — set species, ability, held item, all four moves, nature, EVs, IVs, and Tera type for every slot on your roster.
• Import and export teams using the popular Showdown text format — bring a team in from a calculator or a friend, or take yours out to use elsewhere.
• Ask anything in plain English and get the direct answer plus the reasoning behind it, with cited sources and clear flags when something is uncertain or inferred.
• Switch your entire chat and team builder to the official competitive regulation format with one toggle — no separate app, no manual rule lookups.
• Attach a photo or screenshot — a team sheet, a card, an in-game moment — and ask Oak about it directly.
• Drill into any move, ability, type matchup, or damage calculation in a dedicated detail view without losing your place in the conversation.
• Start chatting instantly as a guest, no account required. Sign in with a one-time email code (no password) when you want your chats and teams saved and synced across devices.

Oak is free to use, with no in-app purchases.

**2,085 / 4000 chars** (well within budget).

## Keywords (100 chars max, hidden, comma-separated, no spaces)

```
type,chart,weakness,coverage,moveset,damage,ev,iv,tera,speed,regulation,showdown,import,reasoning
```
**97 / 100 chars.** Rebuilt for the new App Name/Subtitle: dropped `builder` (now in the Subtitle), `ai` (now in the App Name), and the two lowest-value terms `stat` and `trainer`; added `weakness`, `coverage`, and `speed` — high-intent terms matching the type-matchup and speed-tier features the direct competitors lead with. Full rationale + the deliberately-ceded `vgc` note in `aso-keywords.md`.

## Submission checklist (not produced by this listing — flagged for the user)

- **Privacy Policy URL** — `AccountView` already links to `oak.optiwise.us/privacy`, but no policy exists yet. Apple requires a live URL at submission; this must go live first.
- **Support URL** — points to `www.gowtam.ai/#contact` (an existing, live page), referenced above in the Description's contact line. Confirm the `#contact` section is reachable before submission.
- **App Icon** — still a placeholder in `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`; needs a final design before screenshots/marketing assets that show the icon can be finalized.
