/// (never `LiveChatService`) so they unit-test against `FakeChatService`.
///
/// The method is **synchronous** and returns an `AsyncThrowingStream<SSEEvent, Error>`
/// immediately: it runs in the caller's context (so passing the main-actor-held
/// `[UIImage]` is safe — there is no actor hop), then hands back the stream the
/// view-model's reducer consumes. Pre-stream HTTP failures (rate limit, 413, 503…)
/// surface as a thrown `OakError` from the stream before any event is yielded; an
/// in-band SSE `error` event (transport fault) arrives as `.error(...)`. Every
/// in-domain failure rides a normal `.answer` event whose `OakAnswer.status` carries
/// the failure — never the `error` channel (sse-types.ts).

  /// - `message`: 0–2000 chars; MAY be empty when `images` are attached.
  /// - `images`: attached photos (≤4), encoded to raw base64 with the client-side
  ///   caps enforced by `ImageEncoder`. A cap/type violation finishes the returned
  ///   stream by throwing `OakError.imageRejected(...)` before any event is yielded.
  /// - `scopeSeed`: an explicit scope pick from the header chip, sent as
  ///   `scope_seed`; `nil` ⇒ no pick (server precedence resolves the scope). Scope
  ///   is otherwise server-controlled — the model never sees it as a tool input.
