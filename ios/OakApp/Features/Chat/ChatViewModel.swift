/// The chat thread's view model — the **SSE reducer** at the heart of the chat
/// experience (chat-experience.md M-CHAT-US-1/2/3/4; component-design.md "Streaming
/// reducer"). It holds the visible turns, the in-progress streaming state
/// (tool-activity items + a streamed-text buffer), and the composer state (text +
/// images + Champions mode + active team), and folds the `SSEEvent` stream into UI
/// state one event at a time.
///
/// `@MainActor @Observable` — all state mutates on the main actor and views observe
/// it directly. It depends on the ``ChatService`` **protocol** (never
/// `LiveChatService`) so it unit-tests against `FakeChatService`.
///
/// Reducer contract (sse-types.ts): `tool_activity`* → `answer_start`*/`answer_delta`*
/// → exactly one terminal `answer` (authoritative). On `answer_start` the
/// streamed-text buffer is cleared (the validate-and-re-emit reset) but the
/// tool-activity history is kept; `answer_delta` appends; the terminal `answer`
/// replaces the buffer with the authoritative ``OakAnswer`` and stops. Grok delivers
/// the whole answer in a SINGLE delta, so the reducer must not assume many. An
/// `error` event (or a thrown transport fault) becomes a recoverable banner and
/// never leaves a half-rendered answer (M-AC-4.4). In-domain failures (a non-
/// `answered` status) are rendered as normal answers, never errors (M-AC-1.3).
