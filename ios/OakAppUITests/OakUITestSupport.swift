import XCTest

/// Shared harness for the Oak XCUITest suite (Phase 13 / CP5).
///
/// XCUITest is **black-box**: it drives the app through `XCUIApplication` and cannot
/// `@testable import OakApp`, so every target string here is a literal that mirrors
/// the app's visible text / `accessibilityLabel`s. Centralizing them in one place
/// means a later accessibility-*identifier* pass (more robust than matching the
/// human-readable label) updates a single file.
///
/// ## Live vs hermetic (what runs where)
/// The critical-path and cross-feature flows need a **live backend** (staging) and,
/// for sign-in, a real OTP — they are gated behind ``XCTestCase/requireLiveBackend()``
/// (and ``XCTestCase/requireTestOTP()``) and SKIP cleanly when staging isn't
/// configured. The resilience checks (launch, tab navigation, no-crash) run
/// **hermetically** with no backend. The build-for-testing gate only *compiles* this
/// target; the live E2E run is the deferred human checkpoint **CP5**
/// (`docs/features/iphone-app/architecture/implementation-plan.md`).
///
/// ## Launch-argument contract (the mock seam)
/// ``XCUIApplication/launchOak(_:)`` always passes ``OakUITest/launchFlag`` plus the
/// chosen ``OakUITest/Scenario``. A DEBUG-only test seam in the app *may* honor these
/// to inject `Fake…` services and run the mock scenarios fully offline. Until that
/// seam exists the app ignores the unknown arguments and boots normally — so the
/// hermetic tests still pass and the gated tests still skip. Wiring that seam is an
/// additive, app-owned follow-up documented in `ios/README.md`.
