/**
 * Starter prompts for the fresh-session empty state (ChatThread). A large,
 * curated pool spanning *all* of Oak's capabilities so that, across repeated
 * visits, a user discovers the full range of help on offer — filters, learnsets,
 * mechanics reasoning, type matchups, stat/damage math, lookups, ability/item
 * effects, evolution, catch locations, in-game events/progression, glitches,
 * spin-off games like Mystery Dungeon, and competitive Champions content.
 *
 * Phrasing is **mostly mode-agnostic** (valid in both Standard and Champions),
 * plus a handful of Champions-flavored prompts — Champions is Oak's default
 * scope, so the empty state should reflect that. All prompts avoid out-of-scope
 * topics (franchise MEDIA: anime, movies, TV, manga) so a chip never leads to a
 * dead-end decline. Drawn from the eval golden cases and benchmark questions.
 * Categories below are for authoring only — the array is flat.
 *
 * The "Teams" chips double as discoverability for referring to a saved team by
 * name in chat ("how's my rain team?"): a build chip always produces a team, and
 * "how does my team look?" leads Oak to read the user's saved teams (or, with
 * none / for a guest, offer to build one) — an on-scope reply, never a decline.
